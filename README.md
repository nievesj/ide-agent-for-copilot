A JetBrains IDE plugin that bridges AI coding agents to IntelliJ platform APIs through
**120+ native MCP tools**. Agents work through inspections, refactorings, the test runner,
the build system, and Git — the same tools you use — instead of operating through a terminal
or generating diffs in isolation.

**Key highlights:**

- **6 agents** — Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, Kiro, Junie, OpenCode. Switch with one click.
- **120+ MCP tools** — code navigation, refactoring, testing, debugging, git, project management,
  and more — all through native IntelliJ APIs.
- **Cross-client session resume** — switch agents without losing conversation history.
- **PWA web access** — use the chat from any device on your local network via HTTPS.
- **Human in the loop** — every action is visible in the IDE. Undo, review, or redirect at any point.

## Supported Agents

| Agent                          | Protocol                   | Authentication                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **GitHub Copilot**             | ACP (stdin/stdout)         | OAuth sign-in                 |
| **Claude Code** (`claude` CLI) | Stream JSON (stdin/stdout) | Anthropic auth                |
| **Codex** (`codex app-server`) | ACP (stdin/stdout)         | Device-auth sign-in           |
| **Kiro**                       | ACP (stdin/stdout)         | Amazon auth                   |
| **Junie**                      | ACP (stdin/stdout)         | JetBrains auth                |
| **OpenCode**                   | ACP (stdin/stdout)         | Configurable (multi-provider) |

Switch between agents with one click. Each agent has its own connection settings,
tool permissions, and custom instructions.

## What Agents Can Do

Every action goes through IntelliJ platform APIs — nothing happens behind your back.

**Code intelligence** — Search symbols, find references, go to declaration, type hierarchy,
call hierarchy, class outlines, documentation lookup. Agents navigate code using the IDE's
semantic index, not text grep.

**File operations** — Read, write, create, delete, rename, move files through IntelliJ's
Document API. Every write supports undo/redo and triggers auto-format + import optimization.

**Code quality** — Run inspections, apply quick-fixes, format code, optimize imports, suppress
findings. Agents see the same warnings you see in the editor and can apply IDE-suggested fixes.
Optional Qodana and SonarQube integration.

**Refactoring** — Rename, safe-delete, and PSI-aware symbol replacement through IntelliJ's
refactoring engine. Also: `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_before_symbol`, `insert_after_symbol`
for structural edits that survive reformatting.

**Testing** — Discover tests, run them in the IDE's test runner, collect coverage data.
Results appear in the Run panel so you can watch them live.

**Debugging** — Set breakpoints (line and exception), step through code, inspect variables,
evaluate expressions, read console output. Full interactive debugging through MCP tools.

**Git** — Status, diff, log, blame, commit, stage, branch, stash, push, pull, merge, rebase,
cherry-pick, tag, reset, revert — all through the IDE's VCS layer with editor buffer awareness.

**Project management** — Build, run configurations, project structure, module dependencies,
SDK management, indexing status, source directory marking.

**Infrastructure** — Shell commands, terminal I/O, HTTP requests, IDE log reading, modal
dialog interaction, build/run output reading, user prompts.

**Editor** — Open files, show diffs, scratch files, conversation history search, theme
management.

**Nudge system** — Send mid-turn guidance while the agent is working (Enter), force-stop
and redirect (Ctrl+Enter), or queue follow-up messages (Ctrl+Shift+Enter).

**PWA web access** — Access the chat panel from any device on your local network via HTTPS
with Web Push notifications. Self-signed certificate with a trust endpoint for easy device setup.

**Database** — List data sources, browse tables, inspect schemas. Query execution available
as an experimental tool.

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for the complete tool reference.

## IDE Compatibility

All 120+ tools work across every JetBrains IDE, with a few exceptions for
IDE-specific capabilities:

### Java-only tools (require `com.intellij.modules.java`)

Available in **IntelliJ IDEA** (Ultimate and Community). Not available in WebStorm,
PyCharm, GoLand, PhpStorm, RubyMine, CLion, RustRover, or Rider.

| Tool                     | Why Java-only                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `build_project`          | Triggers JPS incremental build                     |
| `edit_project_structure` | Manages Java-style module dependencies, SDKs, JARs |
| `get_class_outline`      | Resolves fully-qualified Java/Kotlin class names   |
| `get_type_hierarchy`     | Requires Java class hierarchy resolution           |
| `find_implementations`   | Requires Java interface/class hierarchy            |
| `get_call_hierarchy`     | Requires Java method resolution                    |

### Rider-disabled tools

Disabled in **Rider** because C#/C++ PSI lives in the ReSharper backend,
not the IntelliJ frontend. These tools depend on fine-grained PSI or
test framework infrastructure that Rider doesn't expose to the IntelliJ layer.

> Thanks to Reddit user [VirusPanin](https://www.reddit.com/user/VirusPanin/)
> for discovering these limitations by testing AgentBridge in Rider with C++ code.

| Tool                   | Why disabled                                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `search_symbols`       | `classifyElement()` fails on Rider's coarse PSI stubs                         |
| `replace_symbol_body`  | PSI symbol resolution too coarse for structural edits                         |
| `insert_before_symbol` | PSI symbol resolution too coarse for structural edits                         |
| `insert_after_symbol`  | PSI symbol resolution too coarse for structural edits                         |
| `list_tests`           | IntelliJ `TestFramework` extensions don't cover Rider's NUnit/xUnit backend   |
| `run_tests`            | `ConfigurationContext` can't resolve Rider test runners from the frontend PSI |

### Conditional tools (all IDEs)

| Tool(s)                                                                | Condition                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `database_list_sources`, `database_list_tables`, `database_get_schema` | Database plugin installed (bundled with Ultimate editions) |
| `run_sonarqube_analysis`, `get_sonar_rule_description`                 | SonarQube for IDE plugin installed                         |
| `run_qodana`                                                           | Qodana plugin installed                                    |
| `memory_*` (9 tools)                                                   | Memory feature enabled in AgentBridge settings             |

```

**Three layers:**

- **UI** — JCEF-based chat panel, model selector, context management. Agent-agnostic.
- **Clients** — `AcpClient` (shared by Copilot, Junie, Kiro, OpenCode), `ClaudeCliClient`,
  `CodexAppServerClient`. Each wraps its agent CLI's stdin/stdout protocol.
- **MCP** — 120+ tools implemented against IntelliJ's PSI, VFS, and platform APIs. Exposed
  via an HTTP bridge to a bundled MCP stdio server (JAR).

### Cross-Client Session Resume

Conversations are stored in a canonical V2 format (JSONL). When you switch agents,
the session is exported to the new agent's native format — preserving full conversation
history across all six supported agents. See [docs/SESSION-RESUME.md](docs/SESSION-RESUME.md).

### IntelliJ-Native File Operations

Built-in agent file tools (like `bash`, `edit`, `create`) are **denied at the permission
level**. The agent retries using AgentBridge MCP tools, which write through IntelliJ's
Document API — supporting undo/redo, triggering auto-format, and keeping the editor in sync.

## Requirements

- **JetBrains IDE 2025.3+** (IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, Rider, CLion,
  RubyMine, PhpStorm, or any other JetBrains IDE)
- **A supported agent CLI** — at least one of: GitHub Copilot CLI, `claude`, `codex`,
  Kiro, Junie, or OpenCode

For development: **JDK 21** and **Gradle 8.x** (wrapper included).

## Quick Start

### Install from Disk

Build the plugin, then install it:

```bash
./gradlew :plugin-core:buildPlugin
```

In your IDE: **Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk** → select
`plugin-core/build/distributions/plugin-core-*.zip`.

Restart the IDE and open the **AgentBridge** tool window.

### Development Sandbox

For development, run the plugin in a sandboxed IDE instance:

```bash
./restart-sandbox.sh
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full development guide.

### Running Tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Releases & Updates

### How versioning works

Every merge to `master` triggers an automated release. The CI pipeline analyzes
[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) messages to determine the
version bump:

| Commit prefix                      | Bump                        | Example                |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| `feat:`                            | Minor (`1.52.0` → `1.53.0`) | New tool or capability |
| `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc. | Patch (`1.53.0` → `1.53.1`) | Bug fix, cleanup       |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE`      | Major (`1.53.1` → `2.0.0`)  | Breaking change        |

Each release produces a signed ZIP artifact on the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/catatafishen/agentbridge/releases) page with
provenance attestation.

### Standard vs Experimental builds

Each release builds **two** plugin ZIPs:

- **`agentbridge-<version>.zip`** — the standard build, suitable for the JetBrains Marketplace.
- **`agentbridge-experimental-<version>.zip`** — includes additional tools that use internal
  JetBrains APIs or experimental designs. This build is **not published to the Marketplace**
  because internal APIs are unsupported, may break across IDE versions, and are flagged during
  Marketplace review.

### JetBrains Marketplace

The Marketplace is the recommended installation channel — your IDE checks for updates
automatically.

Marketplace submissions require a **review by JetBrains** (typically a few business days),
so not every incremental release is pushed there. Instead, we publish to the Marketplace
periodically and tag that commit as `marketplace-latest`. Each subsequent GitHub release
accumulates a changelog of all changes since the last Marketplace publish, so users can
see exactly what's new.

### Getting updates before the Marketplace

If you want to test a specific fix or feature that hasn't reached the Marketplace yet:

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/catatafishen/agentbridge/releases) and
   download the `agentbridge-<version>.zip` for the version you want.
2. In your JetBrains IDE: **Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk** →
   select the downloaded ZIP.
3. Restart the IDE.

When the next Marketplace update arrives, it will overwrite the manually installed version
and you'll be back on the automatic update track.

### Tags

| Tag                        | Purpose                                                               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` | Every release (created automatically by CI)                           |
| `marketplace-latest`       | Points to the commit currently published on the JetBrains Marketplace |
