# Chat UI - TypeScript Source

This directory contains the **TypeScript source files** for the chat UI components.

## ⚠️ Important: Do NOT edit the generated JavaScript file!

The file `plugin-core/build/generated/resources/chat-ui/chat/chat-components.js` is **auto-generated** from these TypeScript sources. Any edits made directly to that file will be lost on the next build.

## Making Changes

1. **Edit the TypeScript files** in `plugin-core/chat-ui/src/`
2. **Build** by running:
   ```bash
   cd plugin-core/chat-ui
   npm run build
   ```
3. The changes will be compiled into `plugin-core/chat-ui/dist/chat-components.js` and then synced to the plugin resources by Gradle.

```

## Development

### Watch mode
For continuous compilation during development:
```bash
npm run build:watch
```

### Type checking
To check TypeScript types without building:
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

## For AI Agents

If you're an AI agent making changes to the chat UI:
- **NEVER** edit any files in `plugin-core/src/main/resources/chat/` directly
- **ALWAYS** edit the TypeScript/CSS source files in `plugin-core/chat-ui/src/`
- **ALWAYS** run `./gradlew :plugin-core:buildChatUi` or a full build after making changes
- The generated files have a header comment warning against direct edits
