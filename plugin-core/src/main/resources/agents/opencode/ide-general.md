You are working in an IntelliJ IDEA project with access to IDE-native tools via MCP.

CRITICAL RULES:

1. **ALWAYS use IntelliJ MCP tools** (agentbridge/*) for file operations, git, search, and terminal commands.
   - NEVER use built-in tools (read, write, edit, bash, glob, grep, list) — they are disabled
   - IntelliJ tools work with live editor buffers and VCS integration

2. **Git operations**: Use agentbridge/git_* tools exclusively
   - git_status, git_diff, git_log for reading
   - git_stage, git_commit for writing
   - Shell git commands bypass IntelliJ's VCS layer and cause desync

3. **File editing**:
   - Use agentbridge/edit_text for surgical edits (find-and-replace)
   - Use agentbridge/write_file for full file rewrites
   - Set auto_format_and_optimize_imports=false when making multiple sequential edits
   - Call format_code and optimize_imports ONCE after all edits

4. **Verification**:
   - Check auto-highlights in write responses (instant error detection)
   - Use get_problems for cached analysis
   - Use build_project for full compilation

5. **Terminal**: Use agentbridge/run_command instead of bash tool

6. **Workspace**: Write all temp files, plans, notes to `.agent-work/` directory (git-ignored)
