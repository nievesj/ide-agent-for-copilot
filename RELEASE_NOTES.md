# Release Notes - v0.2.0-BETA

**Release Date:** February 26, 2026  
**Status:** Ready for User Testing

## 🎉 Major Improvements

### ✨ New Features

1. **Plan Mode with [[PLAN]] Prefix**
    - Toggle "Plan" mode in toolbar to enable structured planning
    - User prompts automatically prefixed with `[[PLAN]]` for agent awareness
    - Applies to both direct prompts and quick-reply selections

2. **Improved Model Switching**
    - Fixed: Model selection now uses `session/set_model` RPC instead of CLI restart
    - Instant model switching without process interruption
    - Saved model preference applied to new sessions automatically

3. **Code Block Copy Button Fix**
    - Fixed: "Copy" text no longer appears during response streaming
    - Copy button positioned as sibling element (not child of code block)
    - Appears on hover in top-right corner of code blocks

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed model switching - now uses proper ACP RPC instead of CLI restart
- Fixed "Copy" text appearing at start of responses with code blocks
- Fixed empty agent bubble appearing briefly during thinking
- Fixed quick-reply tag detection (requires own line, not inline)

### 🎨 UI Improvements

- Added smooth animations for section collapse/expand (250ms fade + scale)
- Added sub-agent status badges with animated pulse (Working/Done/Failed)
- Improved auth error messaging with actionable suggestions
- Enhanced keyboard accessibility (tabindex, ARIA labels, focus indicators)
- Added code block copy button with theme-aware styling
- Replaced JOptionPane with IntelliJ Messages API (6 locations)

### ♿ Accessibility Improvements

- All interactive elements now keyboard accessible
- Added ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, role attributes)
- Added :focus-visible outlines to all buttons and interactive elements
- Added prefers-reduced-motion media query support
- Proper tab ordering in tool window

### 📱 Theme Support

- Proper dark/light theme colors via JBColor and CSS custom properties
- Theme-adaptive shadows and contrast ratios
- Color injection from Kotlin to CSS variables at runtime

## 📊 Code Quality

### Reduced Warnings

- Extracted 20+ duplicated string literals to constants
- Removed unused function parameters
- Replaced deprecated API calls

**Remaining Issues (non-critical, tracked):**

- 5 high-complexity methods flagged (S3776) - refactoring candidates
- 2 regex complexity warnings - can be simplified
- 3-4 other code quality suggestions (style-related)
